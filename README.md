*what I learned from this lecture*
1. the most important feature of a software is *helping people* and we should try and make things useful and simple at the same time.
2. we should understand our design and the tools we are using.
3. the more complex a code is the more bugs it have.
4. our main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
